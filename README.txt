Erns Consultant – Static Site (Google Sheets Backend via Apps Script)
====================================================================

This site is fully static (HTML/CSS only). The registration form posts to your
Google Apps Script Web App, which writes to a Sheet and emails the admin/student.

Setup (Google Sheets + Apps Script)
-----------------------------------
1) Create a Google Sheet named "Student Registrations". Copy its SHEET_ID from the URL.
2) In the Sheet: Extensions → Apps Script. Replace contents with apps_script/Code.gs from this ZIP.
3) Edit Code.gs:
   - Set SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE'
   - (Optional) Set ADMIN_EMAIL and THANK_YOU_URL
4) Deploy → New deployment → Web app
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
   - Authorize and copy the Web App URL

Wire the Site
-------------
1) Open register.html and replace:
     action="YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL"
   with the URL from step 4.
2) Replace the redirect_url hidden field with your live GitHub Pages URL:
     https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY/thankyou.html

PayPal (Optional)
-----------------
- The button on register.html charges $200 USD to: arichardkwaku@gmail.com
- If your PayPal business email is different, update:
     <input type="hidden" name="business" value="YOUR_PAYPAL_EMAIL">
